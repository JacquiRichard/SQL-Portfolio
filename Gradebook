Create a database to track student grades, with their name, number grade, and what percent of activities they've completed. Select all of the rows, and display the name, number_grade, and percent_completed.Use CASE to designate letter grades. Use COUNT with GROUP BY to show the number of students with each of those grades.

SELECT name, number_grade, ROUND(fraction_completed * 100) AS percent_completed FROM student_grades;

SELECT COUNT(*), CASE
    WHEN number_grade > 90 THEN 'A'
    WHEN number_grade > 80 THEN 'B'
    WHEN number_grade > 70 THEN 'C'
    ELSE 'F'
    END AS letter_grade
FROM student_grades
GROUP BY letter_grade;
